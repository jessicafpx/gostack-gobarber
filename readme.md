# GoBarber
This is a project developed during the Rocketseat's GoStack bootcamp. It is an application that allows appointments of barber shop services. The application allows listing of available barbers, scheduling appointments for clients and monitoring appointments for barbers. It is also possible to make new registrations and use user authentication.

## üìù Project
